## Project Overview
### About
For this project, we collected comprehensive data on job market candidates from the top 20 Economics PhD programs in the United States, including information on gender, fields of study, and dissertation topics. Additionally, we gathered job placement data from the same institutions to analyze the employment outcomes (e.g., company or institution, position) of graduating PhD students.

Our analysis involved generating summary statistics and conducting regression analyses to examine the relationship between gender and job placement outcomes.

## Code Guide 
### Data Scraping using Python
Here is a **very** brief overview of how data scraping works with Python.
1. **Import Required Packages**:
    - To start, you should install and import required packages.
    - Use `requests` to fetch webpage content.
    - Use `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for parsing HTML data.
   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   ```
2. **Fetch Webpage Content**:
    - Use requests.get(URL) to retrieve the HTML or text from a website.
    ```python
    response = requests.get("https://example.com")
    html_content = response.text
     ```
3. **Parse HTML Content**:
    - Use BeautifulSoup to convert raw HTML into a navigable object.
    ```python
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")
    ```
4. **Extract Data**:
    - Locate elements using tags, classes, or IDs (e.g., soup.find_all('tag')).
    ```python
    data = soup.find_all('div', class_='data-class')
    ```
5. **Clean and Structure Data**:
    - Process extracted data into a structured format (e.g., list or dictionary).
6. **Save Data to CSV**:
    - Use pandas or csv to save data for analysis.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    df.to_csv("output.csv", index=False)
    ```

## Analysis
### Key Insights
**Placement by Type**:
- 60.48% of candidates were placed in academic positions.
- 13.73% went to industry roles.
- 11.08% of candidates became postdocs.

**Tabular Representation of Gender Composition**
| Gender  | Overall (%) | Academic (%) | Postdoc (%) |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Male    | 70.65       | 69.60        | 68.57       |
| Female  | 29.35       | 30.40        | 31.43       |

The table presents the gender composition across three categories: overall, academic positions, and postdoc positions. It shows that males comprise approximately 70% of the overall dataset, with a slightly lower percentage in academic and postdoc roles (69.6% and 68.6%, respectively). Conversely, females represent about 29.3% overall, with a slightly higher proportion in academic (30.4%) and postdoc (31.4%) roles, indicating a modest increase in female representation in these specific positions.
